# Bitcoin Prediction using LSTM time series model 

This program trains a Keras based LSTM method to predict the recent Bitcoin market prices. This can be used as a baseline model to improve the prediction on BTC prices. 

I downloaded the 1 year price from https://www.blockchain.com/charts/market-price?timespan=1year

Figure shows the ground truth i.e. real price (red) vs the predicted bitcoin price (blue).
